# Lazy Ass

## Purpose

App to show Notifications after X Seconds, after u unlocked your phone the last time.

     My personal usage: Don't forget the time when browsing your phone between your workout sets.

## Backlog
- Make a click on the Notification open the app
- Clean up the mess around the use of the `AlarmManager` (it seems to not work with Extras in Intents, which lead to copied/unused code)
- app shows seconds to the next notification
- app has countdown to next notification
- Write Unit/Integration tests
- Clean up the rest
- Change from input field to sth that only provides Integers
- add minutes/hours
- technical stuff
    - drive towards this architecture:https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide
    - remove data from activities and recievers
    - use a ViewModel and Databinding(and or expressions): 
    - use room to add a repository with live data that pushed changes to the ViewModel:
